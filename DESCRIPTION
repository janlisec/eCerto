Description: The production of certified reference materials (CRMs) is a core 
    task of the Bundesanstalt für Materialforschung und -prüfung (BAM). 
    Various statistical tests are required and applied depending on the task 
    and recorded data to ensure that reported values of CRMs are appropriate. 
    Many of them are calculated according to the procedures described in 
    `ISO GUIDE 35:2017`. The eCerto package contains a `Shiny` app which 
    provides functionality to load, process and backup data for the statistical 
    evaluation of analyses conducted during CRM production.
