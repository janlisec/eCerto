Description: The production of certified reference materials (CRMs) is a
    core task of the Bundesanstalt für Materialforschung und -prüfung
    (BAM). Various statistical tests are required and applied depending on
    the task and recorded data to ensure that reported values of CRMs are
    appropriate. Many of them are calculated according to the procedures
    described in ISO GUIDE 35:2017.  The eCerto package contains a shiny
    app which provides functionality to load, process and backup data for
    the statistical evaluation of analyses conducted during CRM
    production.
