Description: The production of certified reference materials (CRMs) is a core task of the Bundesanstalt für 
    Materialforschung und -prüfung (BAM). Various statistical tests are required and applied depending on
    the task and recorded data to ensure that reported values of CRMs are appropriate. Many of them are 
    calculated according to the procedures described in ISO GUIDE 35:2017.
    The eCerto package contains a shiny app which provides functionality to load, process and backup data 
    for the statistical evaluation of analyses conducted during CRM production.
