Description: The production of certified reference materials (CRMs) requires 
    various statistical tests depending on the task and recorded data to ensure 
    that reported values of CRMs are appropriate. 
    Often these tests are performed according to the procedures described in 
    'ISO GUIDE 35:2017'. The 'eCerto' package contains a 'Shiny' app which 
    provides functionality to load, process, report and backup data recorded 
    during CRM production and facilitates following the recommended procedures.
    It is described in Lisec et al (2023) <doi:10.1007/s00216-023-05099-3> and
    can also be accessed online <https://apps.bam.de/shn00/eCerto/> without 
    package installation.
