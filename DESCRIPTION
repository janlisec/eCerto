Description: The production of certified reference materials (CRMs) is 
    a core task of the Bundesanstalt für Materialforschung und -prüfung
    (BAM). Various statistical tests are required and applied depending 
    on the task and recorded data to ensure that reported values of CRMs 
    are appropriate. Many of them are calculated according to the proce-
    dures described in ISO GUIDE 35:2017. The eCerto package contains a 
    `Shiny` app which provides functionality to load, process and backup 
    data for the statistical evaluation of analyses conducted during CRM
    production.
