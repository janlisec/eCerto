\description{
\code{get_local_file} will provide a full file path using the
currently specified 'www' folder specified as a recourcePaths. This path
can be different depending on whether the app is run as development
version, using the library function or serving via shinyapps.io.

\details{
Developing a shiny app as an R package in parallel leads to difficulties
on where to find specific files after installation (e.g. font descriptions,
markdown documents etc.). The function \code{get_local_file} will search
a specified pattern in the current recourcePaths for 'www'.
