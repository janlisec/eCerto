### LTS Statistics

The Tool calculates the expected life time of a reference material in several steps:

- calculating a linear model for the measurement data $y=m*x+n$, where $y$ represent measured values and $x$ represents time (expressed in month) and
- correcting the intercept $n$ for the difference between the mean obtained from LTS data and the mean reported as certified value on import $n'=n+mean-cert\_val$
- using the corrected $n'$ and $m$ to estimate the timepoint when the value of the certified analyte is expected to  exceede the range of $cert\_val\pm~U$.
