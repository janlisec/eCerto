## General information

*eCerto* is an online tool written in R/Shiny to facilitate the statistical evaluation of data collected in connection with the production of certified reference materials (CRMs) at Bundesanstalt für Materialforschung und -prüfung (BAM).

The standard workflow consistes of a certification trial in combination with homogeneity and stability assays. Data from all of these assays need to be collected, combined and analyzed to report certified values of measured properties or entities of a reference material. 

### User/Study information

### Data backup/retrieval

Previous analyses can be read from a backup file and will contain all input data and previously set parameters.
