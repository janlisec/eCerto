### Certification data upload (Excel)

To process a new analysis, please collect all data which should be returned in
pre-defined Excel-Files by your certification trial partners and stored within
one folder. Pre-defined means that the analytical results are at the same
position within each file (table name, row and column range) and that exactly
one file per laboratory exists.

***Note!*** 
Please select the range without a header as shown in the figure below. *eCerto*
assumes the first and second column of the specified range to contain analyte 
names and units respectively and replicate measurements of this analyte in all 
remaining columns.

File names will be stored for reference but imported labs will be consecutively 
numbered. In the example above you would import data from sheet 1 of each Excel 
file located in Range A7:H9, containing 6 replicate measurements of 3 different 
analytes (column A) measured in units as specified in column B.

***Note!*** 
Currently, *eCerto* needs to load all Excel result files in one step, *i.e.* you 
can not add additional files later on but would have to start all over again.
However, this is reasonable as statistics will change upon addition of new values 
which in turn might require adjustments in rounding precision or filtered labs.
