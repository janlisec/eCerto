## Long Term Stability (LTS)

*eCerto* can be used to monitor long term stability of a material. To this end, two approaches
were implemented. A quick post certification check for stability can be preformed in the Certification
module next to **Tab.C3**. There, calculation of $\mathit{SK}$ allows to access if analyte values
within a material can still be considered stable at measurement time of control samples.

However, to estimate long term stability prospectively, measurement data can be continuously 
obtained and stored using the LTS module of *eCerto* as described below.

```{r child = 'lts_dataupload.Rmd'}
```

```{r child = 'lts_fig_L1.Rmd'}
```

```{r child = 'lts_tab_L1.Rmd'}
```

### LTS report

The user can export a PDF report containing all imported, edited and calculated data and figures.
