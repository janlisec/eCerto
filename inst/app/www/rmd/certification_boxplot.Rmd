### Certified value calculation and vizualization of the currently selected analyte

Lab means and their measurement distribution is depicted in a standard graphic layout which can be exported as vector graphic (PDF) for further editing.
Labs which have been identified as outliers above can be excluded from the overall mean calculation in the parameter section at the top of the page.
This decision has to be made by the user, *eCerto* will not remove any outlier automatically. However, *eCerto* keeps track of the removal and
indicates the neglected lab values in the plot as grey data points.

Besides `width` and `height` adjustment, the plot can be modified to include individual measurement using their ID (`Show IDs`). 
This can be usefull to identify potential individual outliers.
Further, x-axis annotation can be switched between using anonymous `Lx` values or the imported file names as labels.
