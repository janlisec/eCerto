### Certified value calculation and vizualization of the currently selected analyte

Lab means and their measurement distribution is depicted in a standard graphic 
layout which can be exported as vector graphic (PDF) for further editing. Labs 
which have been identified as outliers in Tab.C1 can be excluded from the 
overall mean calculation in the analyte parameter section at the top of the page. 
This decision has to be made by the user, *eCerto* will not remove any outlier 
automatically. However, *eCerto* keeps track of the removal and indicates the 
omitted lab values in the plot as grey data points.

Besides `width` and `height` adjustment, the plot can be modified to include 
individual measurement using their ID (`Show sample IDs`). This can be useful 
to identify potential individual outlier samples. Further, x-axis annotation 
can be altered to show anonymous `Lx` values or the imported file names as 
labels.
