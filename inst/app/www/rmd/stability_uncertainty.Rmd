### Stability uncertainty calculation

The parameters of all linear models are collected in **Tab.S1** and the potential
uncertainty contribution of the material stability is obtained from formula 
$u_{stab}=|m \times err|$ where $m$ is the `slope` of the linear model and $err$ is 
the standard error `SE` of the slope. 

As we express time in month, the slope $m$ represents a monthly change of the measured
property and can be used to estimate shelf life should $m$ be significant.

To determine if the slope $m$ is significantly different from $m=0$ we perform a t-test by 
calculating the t-statistic $t_m = |m| / s(m)$ and comparing the result with the two-tailed 
critical value of Student's $t$ for n - 2 degrees of freedom to obtain the P-values in column `P`.

***Note!***
Clicking on a table row will display the analysis for the analyte specified in this row.

Values from column `u_stab` can be transfered to the material table of the certification module 
in case that matching analyte names are found (analyte names are depicted in red if not found).
