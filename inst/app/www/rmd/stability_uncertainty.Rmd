### Stability Uncertainty calculation

The uncertainty contribution of the stability measurements `U_Stab` is calculated for each analyte based on a linear model of `Value` on `Date`. 
The parameters of each model are combined using formula $$U_{Stab}=abs(m \times err)$$ where $m$ is the `slope` of the linear model and $err$ is the standard error `SE` of the slope. 

***Note!***
Clicking on a table row will display the analysis for this analyte.

`U_Stab` can be transfered to the material table of the certification module in case that matching analyte names are found.
