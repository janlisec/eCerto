### Analyte options

For analytes under inspection (i.e. which are selected in **Tab.C3**), several analyte specific
parameters can be set. 

![**User Options** Possible options which can be set per individual analyte](fig/C_Modul_AnalyteOptions.png)

Samples can be filtered by ID (select `show IDs` in **Fig.C1** to identify outlier IDs). 
These samples will not be used in *any* calculations. They are removed from downstream processing 
right after import. However, information of this filtering step is preserved and included in reports.

Labs can be excluded by Lab-ID. Please note, that this is done *after* statistical testing for 
mean and variance outliers (**Tab.C1** and **Tab.C2**). Filtered labs are depicted in **Fig.C1** 
(using grey color), but excluded from calculating the certified value of the analyte.

Because analytes within an RM might be measured at very different scales it is possible to specify 
independent precision values for rounding. The `precision (stats)` value is used for all displayed values 
in tables except for **Tab.C3**. Here, `precision (cert)` might be specified as an independet precision 
depending on the DIN regulations which apply to the certificate.

*eCerto* suggests the rounding precision for $\mu_c$ and $U_{abs}$ according to DIN 1333. Here, the position
of the significant digit is determined based on the first non-zero digit in $U_{abs}$. Once found, the
respective digit will be rounded up for $\mu_c$ if the consecutive digit is $\ge 5$ and down otherwise.
For $U_{abs}$ the rounding procedure is a bit more complicated. If the respective digit is 1 or 2, than
the consecutive digit will be rounded up. If the respective digit is $\ge 3$, than it will be rounded up itself.

The user can specify negative numbers for `Precision (cert)`, *i.e.* $-1$ to round an uncertainty of 13 up to 14
or $-2$ to round 13 up to 20. If the uncertainty is even larger, the user should consider to upload data using
a different (more appropriate) unit and, for instance, switch from mg/L to g/L.

***Note!***
Internally, all calculations are performed on non-rounded values (as imported).

`pooling` means that calculations in the material table (`mean`, `sd` and uncertainty columns) are 
not based on the lab means, but rather on all measured values. This is justified when the between lab 
variance is smaller than the within lab variance. Selecting this option will also affect `n` in **Tab.C3** 
being either the number of included labs or the number of finite data points from these labs.
