### Features and data preparation

*eCerto* implements statistical procedures for analytical method validation
according to DIN 32645:2008-11.

The method performance characteristics reported by *eCerto* comprise working
range, linearity, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ) ...

The statistical tests implemented in *eCerto* according to DIN 32645:2008-11 
comprise outlier tests (Grubbs), trend tests (Neumann), tests for homogeneity 
of variance (F-Test), ...

The implemented formulas are provided or referenced in the respective help
sections.

To compute the relevant performance characteristics of an analytical method, 
*eCerto* will evaluate replicate measurements of a dilution series of samples 
containing any number of target analytes and their internal standards.

For advice on concentration range, replicate number and calibration levels
tested, we refer to DIN 32645:2008-11
