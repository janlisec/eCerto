### Stability Data upload (Excel)

Please prepare data in a single Excel file on seperate tables for each analyte as shown in the below example.

Table names have to match analyte names from the Certification module to be properly assigned. 
Column names need to be exactly `Value` and `Date` with Excel column formats set to *numeric* and *date* respectively.

Upload can be also achieved from a previousy created backup file. 
If a backup file does not contain any stability data, the Excel upload option will remain active (and will be deactivated if stbility data are contained).
