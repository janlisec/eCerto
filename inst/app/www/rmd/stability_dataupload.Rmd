### Stability Data upload (Excel)

Please prepare data in a single Excel file on seperate tables for each analyte as shown in the below example.

Table names have to match analyte names from the Certification module to be properly assigned. 
Column names need to be exactly `Value` and `Date` with Excel column formats set to *numeric* and *date* respectively.

Stability data can also be uploaded using a more complex data format to allow shelf life calculations based on the Arrhenius model.
To this end, the user needs to prepare a single Excel table including the columns `analyte`, `Temp`, `Date`, `Value` and `unit`.

**Note!**
Upload can be also achieved from a previousy created backup file. 
If a backup file does not contain any stability data, the Excel upload option will remain active (and will be deactivated if stbility data are contained).
