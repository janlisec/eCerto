### Stability data upload (Excel)

Please prepare data in a single Excel file on seperate tables for each analyte as shown 
in the below example.

Table names have to match analyte names from the Certification module to be properly assigned. 
Column names need to be exactly `Value` and `Date` with Excel column formats set to 
*numeric* and *date* respectively.

Stability data can also be uploaded using a more complex data format to allow shelf life 
calculations based on the Arrhenius model. To this end, the user needs to prepare a single 
Excel table including the columns `analyte`, `Temp`, `Date`, `Value` and `unit`.

***Note!***
Upload can be also achieved from a previousy created backup file. If a backup file does not 
contain any stability data, the Excel upload option will remain active (and will become 
deactivated if stability data are contained).
