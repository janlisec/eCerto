### Fig.V1 - Working range

The working range of an analytical method is tested using the relative 
analyte values $x_r$ of the smallest and the largest calibration level, $j_1$
and $j_N$.

Relative analyte values are computed as $x_r = \frac {x_{i,j}} {\overline{x}_j}$ 
with $x_{i,j}$ being the peak area ratios of analyte and internal standard 
$x_{i,j}=\frac{A_\text{Analyte}}{A_\text{IS}}$ for each replicate $i$ at calibration level
$j$.

For each $x_j$ in total $n$ replicate values exist and are tested:

- to follow a normal distribution (Kolmogorof-Smirnov Test, $P_{KS}$)
- to exhibit outliers (Grubbs-Test for single $P_{Grubbs1}$ and double $P_{Grubbs2}$ outliers)
- to show a trend, *i.e.* a drift associated with measurement order (Neumann-Test, $P_{Neumann}$)

The two calibration levels $j_1$ and $j_N$ are tested for homogeneity 
of variance using an F-Test.
