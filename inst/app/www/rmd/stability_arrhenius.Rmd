The Arrhenius approach is one way to estimate the stability of a reference material 
from the perspective of storage time or shelf life. As implemented in *eCerto*, 
the estimation is based on time series data of analytes at different temperature levels $T_i$.

$T_{min}$ is used as a reference point. For each $T_i$ a linear model is calculated, 
yielding potentially a slope $m_i$ indicative of analyte degradation. Combining all $m_i$ 
allows to estimate the dependency of analyte stability on temperature and, consequently, 
the expected storage time at a given $T$.

The calculations are performed according to the recommendations for accelerated stability studies in ISO GUIDE 35:2017.
