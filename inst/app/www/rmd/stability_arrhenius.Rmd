### Stability Arrhenius calculation

***Note!***
This section is currently under development and will be subject to future changes.

The Arrhenius approach is one way to estimate the stability of a reference material from the perspective of storage time.

The storage time is calculated for each evaluated temperature level using $ln({c_i-s_i \over c_i})$
