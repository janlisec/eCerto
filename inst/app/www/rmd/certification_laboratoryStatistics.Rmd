### Laboratory statistics to identify potential outliers for lab means and lab variances

For an analyte selected in **Tab.C3** various statistical tests regarding lab means and 
variance will be performed according to ISO 17025 and outlying values will be indicated 
if observed at the `.05` and `.01` level respectively. The displayed values `n.s.` and 
`.` indicate either that the test probability was >0.05 or that this lab was not tested
because it did not contain an extreme value.

Instead of the qualitative significance levels reached in the test, the options panel
to the right of **Tab.C1** offers the possibility to display the calculated p-values
directly for some of the tests. As a third option, the calculated test statistic can
be displayed to check with manual calculations.

***Note!*** *eCerto* performs outlier tests at the lower and upper end of the value
distribution independently (two one sided tests).

If any lab is excluded after inspection of **Tab.C1** and using the filter section of 
the analyte panel on top of the page, all tests can be conducted also without filtered 
labs to confirm that no further outliers are present after removal.

Except for `Cochran`, which tests for outliers with respect to variance, all other columns 
indicate potential outliers regarding lab means.

To compute the statistical tests *eCerto* uses functions from different packages available 
for **R**. Details regarding the conducted statistical test (implementation, parameters) 
can be found using the following links:

***Note!*** 
Similar letters indicate similar group and hence no difference. The test is performed at 
two $\alpha$ levels (.01 and .05).
* <a href="https://rdrr.io/cran/outliers/man/dixon.test.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dixon</a>
***Note!*** 
The Dixon-Test was developed for small sample sizes and will only work for $3 \le n \le 30$.

***Note!*** 
Test is performed as single (only the most extreme value at each end of the distribution 
is tested) as well as double version (the two most extreme values are tested against the 
rest). Similar to Dixon the test is only applied for $3 \le n \le 30$.

This test is implemented based on a website including the critical values table.

***Note!*** 
This test is performed consecutively, *i.e.* the Lab showing the highest variance is tested 
first. If significant, it is removed and the procedure is repeated. `excl` indicates that 
the `sd` of a lab was too low and the lab was removed from the testing procedure.

***Note!***
Most tests require at least 3 data points (Labs) and finite differences in Lab means and Lab variances.
If these conditions are not fulfilled `Error` might be reported instead of a P-value.
