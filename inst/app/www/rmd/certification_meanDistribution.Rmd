### Statistics on the distribution of lab means

The distribution of lab means is evaluated using a variety of recommended tests. Normality of the distribution is tested using the KS-Test. Besides `mean` and `sd` the robust alternatives `median` and `MAD`are provided. Columns which end on `_p` provide P-values of the respective tests. Skewness and Kurtosis are computed additionally and grouped with their respective tests (Agostino and Anscombe).
