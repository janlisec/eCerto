### Statistics on the distribution of lab means

The distribution of lab means is evaluated using a variety of recommended tests. 
Normality of the distribution is tested using the KS-Test. Besides `mean` and `sd` 
the robust alternatives `median` and `MAD`are provided. Columns which end on `_p` 
provide P-values of the respective tests. Skewness and Kurtosis are computed 
additionally and grouped with their respective tests (Agostino and Anscombe).

To compute the statistical tests *eCerto* uses functions from different packages 
available for **R**. Details regarding the conducted statistical test can be found

***Note!*** 
Some tests need a minimum number of replicates and will not yield a result if this 
criteria is not met (*i.e.* Agostino).

The `KS test` is used to compare the distribution of Lab means against a normal distribution.
Besides the respective P-value, also a QQ-plot can be opened using the respective link.
