### Homogeneity specimen stats

To ensure the homogeneity of the reference material before conducting a collaborative trial, 
a number of specimen should be analyzed for the analytes of interest in $n$ replicate measurements.

In **Tab.H2** numeric values `mean` and `sd` for each specimen receive a unique ID (`Flasche`), 
complementary to the x-axis label of **Fig.H1**.
