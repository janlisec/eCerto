### Homogeneity Statistics

The uncertainty contribution of the Homogeneity measurements `U_bb` (uncertainty between bottles) is calculated for each analyte 
based on variance obtained by an ANOVA and is transfered to a user specified column in the material table of the certification module.

***Note!***
Transfer is only sucessfull in case that an analyte of matching name can be found found (see colum `In_Cert_Module`).

```{r child = 'homogeneity_boxplot.Rmd'}

```{r child = 'homogeneity_uncertainty.Rmd'}
```

Figures and tables can currently be exported in PDF format. 

***Note!***
Report layout and format are currently under debate and might change in the future depending on user demand.
