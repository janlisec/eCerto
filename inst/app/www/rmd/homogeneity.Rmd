## Homogeneity

```{r child = 'homogeneity_dataupload.Rmd'}
```

### Homogeneity statistics

The uncertainty contribution of the Homogeneity measurements `u_bb` (uncertainty between bottles) is calculated 
for each analyte based on variance obtained by an ANOVA and is transferred to a user specified column in 
the material table of the certification module (**Tab.C3**).

***Note!***
Values for `u_bb` can be transferred to **Tab.C3** in case that matching analyte names are present 
(analyte names are depicted in red if not found).


```{r child = 'homogeneity_boxplot.Rmd'}
```

```{r child = 'homogeneity_uncertainty.Rmd'}
```

### Homogeneity report

Figures and tables can currently be exported in HTML format. 

***Note!***
Report layout and format are currently under debate and might change in the future depending on user demand.
