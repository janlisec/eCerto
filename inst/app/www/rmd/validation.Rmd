## Method validation

***Note!***
The Validation module is an add-on to *eCerto*. It is not required to compute CRM
statistics. It is ment to quickly validate working area and linearity of a newly
developed analytical method. As it is currently work-in-progress, available
options and output format might change in the future.


```{r child = 'v_datapreparation.Rmd'}
```

```{r child = 'v_dataupload.Rmd'}
```

```{r child = 'v_fig_V1.Rmd'}
```

```{r child = 'v_tab_V1.Rmd'}
```

```{r child = 'v_trueness.Rmd'}
```

```{r child = 'v_precision.Rmd'}
```

```{r child = 'v_uncertainty.Rmd'}
```

```{r child = 'v_formula_collection.Rmd'}
```

### Validation report and data backup

The user can export a report, in HTML or docx format, containing all imported, 
edited and calculated data and figures.

For later reference, all data and parameters can be stored (and reimported) in an
RData file.
