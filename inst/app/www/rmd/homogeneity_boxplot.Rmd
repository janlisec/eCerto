### Homogeneity boxplot

Statistical differences between groups are nicely visualized using boxplots. 
While the ANOVA allows to calculate a probability testing the hypothesis that 
the mean values of different groups are similar or not, the boxplot visualizes 
the distribution of values within each group.

The box comprises 50% of the measured values of a group (from 25% to 75% quartile) 
and highlights the median (50% quartile). Overlapping boxes indicate that a t-test 
would not yield a significant P-value.

Within **Fig.1** dashed black and grey lines indicate $\mu$ and $s$ of the
distribution of specimen means from **Tab.2**.
