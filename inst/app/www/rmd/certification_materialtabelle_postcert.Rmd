### Post certification

To check if the certified values of a CRM, $\mu_c$ and $u_c$, remain stable, 
a post certification measurement can be performed and evaluated according 
to ISO GUIDE 35:2017 (8.10.3.2) by calculating a stability criterium $\mathit{SK}$
using formula:

$$\mathit{SK} = {|\mu_c - \mu_m| \over \sqrt{u_c^2 + u_m^2}}$$

where $\mu_m$ and $u_m$ are mean and standard deviation of post certification 
measurements performed on a CRM specimen, and where $u_c$ is the absolute
certified uncertainty without expansion, $u_c = u_{com} \times \mu_c$.
If $\mathit{SK} \le k$ is fulfilled, this indicates that the material is sufficiently 
stable.

***Note!***
$k$ is similar to the expansion factor set during certification (see **Tab.C3**).
