### Homogeneity Uncertainty calculation

Conducting an analysis of variance (ANOVA) on a one factor linear model we determine from $N$ bottles/containers with $n$ replicates each the variance within bottles $s_w$ (MS_within) and the variance between bottles $s_a$ (MS_among).

***Note!*** To account for the case of different number of replicates over all $N$ bottles, $n$ is calculated according to ISO GUIDE 35 as:

$$n=\frac{1}{N-1}*\left[\sum_{i=1}^N{n_i}-\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N{n_i^2}}{\sum_{i=1}^N{n_i}}\right]$$

where $n_{i}$ is the vector of replicates per group.

Together with the overall mean vlaue $\mu$ (mean of all $N$ bottle means), we now can compute two relative uncertainties between bottles:

$$s_{bb}={\sqrt{s_a-s_w \over n} \over \mu}$$

and

$$s_{bb, min}={\sqrt{s_w/n}*\frac{2}{N*(n-1)}^{1/4} \over \mu}$$

The larger of both values, $s_{bb}$ and $s_{bb,min}$, is selected as uncertainty contribution. 

***Note!*** $s_{bb}=0$ for $s_{a} < s{_w}$
