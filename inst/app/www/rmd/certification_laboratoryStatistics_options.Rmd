Instead of the qualitative significance levels reached in the test, the options 
panel to the right of **Tab.C1** offers the possibility to display the calculated 
`P-values` directly for most of the tests. Further, the calculated `test statistic` 
values can be displayed. The user can also select to show the `critical values` 
at $\alpha=0.05$ and $\alpha=0.01$. Depending on the test these are calculated 
based on the underlying distributions or obtained from tabulated values.

If any lab is excluded after using the filter section of the analyte panel on 
top of the page, all tests in **Tab.C1** can be conducted without filtered labs 
selecting the option `Exclude filtered Labs`. This feature allows to confirm 
whether or not further outliers are present in the data set. Please use the 
possibility to remove outliers sequentially with caution, *i.e.* refrain from
*over exclusion* of initially masked outliers.
