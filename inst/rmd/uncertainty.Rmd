Conducting the analysis of variance (ANOVA) on a one factor linear model we determined from $N$ bottles/containers with $n$ replicates each the variance within bottles $s_w$ (MS_within) and the variance between bottles $s_a$ (MS_among). Together with the overall mean vlaue $\mu$ (mean of all $N$ bottle means), we now can compute two relative uncertainties between bottles:

$$s_{bb}={\sqrt{s_a-s_w} \over \mu}$$

and

$$s_{bb, min}={\sqrt{s_w/n}*\frac{2}{N*(n-1)}^{1/4} \over \mu}$$ 
The larger of both values, $s_{bb}$ and $s_{bb,min}$, is transfered as uncertainty contribution to the column in the material table selected by the user. 

**Note**: $s_{bb}=0$ for $s_a<s_w$.
